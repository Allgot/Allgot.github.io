I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

My research focuses on secure and open communication on the Internet, where I analyze protocols to find vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy. My main research interests include:
- Network Security and Privacy;
- Internet Measurement;
- Censorship and Surveillance.

Please refer to my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf), [B.S.](assets/pdf/Transcript_BS.pdf) and [M.S.](assets/pdf/Transcript_MS.pdf) transcripts for details.
