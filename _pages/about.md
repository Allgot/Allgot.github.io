I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at KAIST.
My research focuses on secure and open communication on the Internet, where I analyze protocols to find vulnerabilities that compromise user privacy. My main research interests include:
- Network Security and Privacy;
- Anonymity Networks;
- Internet Measurement;
- Censorship and Surveillance.

Please see my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf), [B.S.](assets/pdf/Transcript_BS.pdf) and [M.S.](assets/pdf/Transcript_MS.pdf) transcripts for more details.
You can also take a look at my [CV of Failures](assets/pdf/CVF.pdf) to see some of the setbacks I have encountered.
