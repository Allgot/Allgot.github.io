Today, I am honored to have been awarded the Presidential Science Scholarship for Graduate Students!
I am deeply grateful to the Korea Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF) for their generous support, which will provide financial assistance throughout my Ph.D. program, for up to four years.
With this support, I will do my utmost to contribute to secure communication on the Internet.
