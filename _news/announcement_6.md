Today, I am honored to have been awarded the [Presidential Science Scholarship for Graduate Students](https://www.kosaf.go.kr/ko/info.do?mode=view&searchStr=&searchType=s&page=19&ctgrId1=&ctgrId2=&seqNo=18746&pg=press01_02)!
I am deeply grateful to the Korea Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF) and the president of the Republic of Korea for their generous support, which will provide financial assistance throughout my Ph.D. program for up to four years.
With this support, I will contribute to secure communication on the Internet.
