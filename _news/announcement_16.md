I am delighted to share that I have been invited to present our work, "Onions Got Puzzled: On the Challenges of Mitigating Denial-of-Service Problems in Tor Onion Services," originally presented at [USENIX Security 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/lee), at the [RSAC 2026 Conference](https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us26/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1770657573193001leZ8). See you in San Francisco this March!
